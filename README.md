## How it works?
The project uses reactJS. `react-router-dom` is used for the routing. `react-bootstrap` is used for most of the styling. `react-helmet` is used to be able to set the meta tags and title dynamically. The site is hosted using github pages on a free domain provided by [is-a.dev](https://www.is-a.dev/)
